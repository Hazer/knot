Consice reactive state container library for Android applications.

# Concept

Knot helps managing application state by reacting on events and performing asynchronous actions in a structured way. There are five core concepts Knot defines: `State`, `Change`, `Reducer`, `Effect` and `Action`.

`State` represents an immutable partial state of an Android application. It can be a state of a screen or a state of an internal headless component, like repository.

`Change` is an immutable data object with an optional payload intended for changing the `State`. A `Change` can be produced from an external event or be a result of execution of an `Action`.

`Action` is a synchronous or an asynchronous operation which, when completed, can emit a new `Change`.

`Reducer` is a function that takes the previous `State` and a `Change` as arguments and returns the new `State` and an optional `Action` wrapped by `Effect` class. `Reducer` in Knot is designer to stays side-effects free because each side-effect can be turned into an `Action` and returned from reducer function together with a new state.

`Effect` is a convenient wrapper class containing the new `State` and an optional `Action`. If `Action` is present, Knot will perform it and provide resulting `Change` back to `Reducer`.

# Composition

If your knot becomes big and you want to improve its maintainability and extensibility you may consider to decompose it. You start decomposition by grouping related functionality into, in a certain sense, indecomposable pieces called `Prime`'s.

`Prime` defines its own `Change`'s, `Action`'s and reducer for own changes. It's only the `State`, what is shared between the `Prime`'s. In that respect each `Prime` can be considered to be a separate knot working on a shared `State`. Once all `Prime`'s are defined, they can be composed together and provided to `CompositeKnot` which implements standard knot interface. 

# Why Knot?

* Structured - helps writing better structured and less buggy code.
* Modular - single knots can be combined together to build more complex application logic.
* Decomposable - complex knots can be decomposed into primes by related functionality.
* Consice - it has minimalistic API and compact implementation.
* Consistent - state is the single source of truth.
* Testable - reducers and transformers are easy to test. 
* DSL - easy to read and write declarative configuration language.
* Why not?
