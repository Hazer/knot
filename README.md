Lightweight reactive state container library for Android applications.

# Concept

Knot helps managing application state, external events and asynchronous actions. It defines five core concepts for achiving this: `State`, `Change`, `Reducer`, `Effect` and `Action`.

`State` represents an immutable partial state of an Android application. It can be a state of a screen or a state of an internal headless component.

`Change` is an immutable data object with an optional payload intended for changing the `State`. A `Change` can be produced from an external event or be a result of execution of an `Action`.

`Action` is a reactive single value respose which, when completed, emits a new `Change`. 

`Reducer` is a function that takes the previous `State` and a `Change` as arguments and returns an `Effect`. 

`Effect` is a convenience wrapper class similar to `Pair` class. If contains a new `State` and an optional `Action` which, when present, will be executed.
