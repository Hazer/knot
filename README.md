Consice reactive state container library for Android applications.

# Concept

Knot helps managing application state by reacting on events and performing asynchronous actions in a structured way. There are five core concepts Knot defines: `State`, `Change`, `Reducer`, `Effect` and `Action`.

`State` represents an immutable partial state of an Android application. It can be a state of a screen or a state of an internal headless component, like repository.

`Change` is an immutable data object with an optional payload intended for changing the `State`. A `Change` can be produced from an external event or be a result of execution of an `Action`.

`Action` is a synchronous or an asynchronous operation which, when completed, can emit a new `Change`.

`Reducer` is a function that takes the previous `State` and a `Change` as arguments and returns the new `State` and an optional `Action` wrapped by `Effect` class.

`Effect` is a convenient wrapper class containing the new `State` and an optional `Action`. If `Action` is present, Knot will perform it and provide resulting `Change` back to `Reducer`.

# Composition
To be added

# Why Knot?

* Structured - helps writing better structured and less buggy code.
* Modular - single knots can be combined together to build more complex application logic.
* Decomposable - complex knots can be decomposed into primes by related functionality.
* Consice - it has minimalistic API and compact implementation.
* Testable - reducer function is easy to test. 
* DSL - easy to read declarative configuration.
* Why not?
