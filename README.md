Lightweight reactive state container library for Android applications.

# Concept

Knot helps managing application state, external events and asynchronous actions in a structured way. There are five core concepts Knot defines: `State`, `Change`, `Reducer`, `Effect` and `Action`.

`State` represents an immutable partial state of an Android application. It can be a state of a screen or a state of an internal headless component, like repository.

`Change` is an immutable data object with an optional payload intended for changing the `State`. A `Change` can be produced from an external event or be a result of execution of an `Action`.

`Action` is an asynchronous operation which, when completed, can emit a new `Change`.

`Reducer` is a function that takes the previous `State` and a `Change` as arguments and returns an `Effect`. 

`Effect` is a convenient wrapper class containing a new `State` and an optional `Action` which, when is present, will be performed.

# Why Knot?

* Predictable - helps writing better structured and less buggy code.
* Modular - single knots can be combined together to build more complex application logic.
* Testable - reducer function is easy to test. 
* DSL - easy to read declarative configuration.
* Why not?

# Considerations

* In contrast to the most of state container implementations out there, `Action` in Knot is an executable object and not a data class. This is done to reduce boilerplate code needed for defining actions and writing an action creator class. This decision can be revisit in the future however.
